       <li><strong>1941</strong> - Calloway fired Gillespie over an altercation between the two. Which involved someone spitballs thrown in rehearsal... ultimately ending with Gillespie stabbing Calloway in the leg and getting fired after the altercation.</li>
       <li><strong></strong>
       <li><strong>1943</strong> - Dizzy did not serve in WWII and was labeled a "4-F"; not suited for service. At the time he told the local board: "in this stage of my life here in the United States whose foot has been in my ass?" and "So if you put me out there with a gun in my hand and tell me to shoot at the enemy, I'm liable to create a case of 'mistaken identity' of who I might shoot."</li>
      <li><strong></strong>
      <li><strong>1942-1947</strong> - The rise of bebop; Dizzy would be seen playing with the likes of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane' target='_blank' id='link'>John Coltrane</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalo_Schifrin' target='_blank' id='link'>Lalo Schifrin</a>, and<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusef_Lateef' target='_blank' id='link'>Yusef Lateef</a> to name a few.</li>

These compositions were radically different harmonically and rhythmically from the swing music that was popular at the time, and helped define bebop's unique style.</li>
